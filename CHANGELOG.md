- **Protocols**: PQXDH, Double Ratchet, PAKE (OPAQUE-like), Threshold/Shamir+Feldman VSS
- **Unified Crypto API**: algorithm registry, unified sign/verify/encrypt/decrypt across all algorithms
- **Server v2 API**: 34+ REST endpoints for all modern crypto operations with JSON schema validation
- **CLI v2**: modern commands for keygen, hash, encrypt, sign, password hashing
- **SDK**: type-safe fetch-based client covering all v2 server endpoints
- **10 new packages**: crypto-edge, crypto-kms, crypto-middleware, crypto-prisma, crypto-react, crypto-sdk, crypto-testing, crypto-typeorm, crypto-vue, crypto-wasm
- **Server security**: JWT + API key auth, scope-based RBAC, rate limiting, CORS, Helmet, OpenTelemetry
- **100% test coverage** across all 14 packages (~2023 tests)
- **100% JSDoc/TypeDoc coverage** with 0 warnings

### Deprecated

- **v1 API routes** (OpenPGP-based): `/v1/encrypt`, `/v1/decrypt`, `/v1/generate`, `/v1/verify`, `/v1/revoke` — use v2 endpoints instead. Sunset date: 2027-01-01.

### Changed

- Migrated from yarn/lerna to pnpm workspaces
- Upgraded to Node.js >= 22.0.0
- Switched from OpenPGP-only to @noble/\* primitives for modern crypto
- Monorepo restructured from 4 packages to 14 packages
